abstract = {This book provides a thorough introduction to the mathematical and
algorithmic aspects of certified reduced basis methods for parametrized
partial differential equations. Central aspects ranging from model
construction, error estimation and computational efficiency to empirical
interpolation methods are discussed in detail for coercive problems.
More advanced aspects associated with time-dependent problems, non-compliant
and non-coercive problems and applications with geometric variation
are also discussed as examples.},
